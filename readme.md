**About the page** <br/>
**To-Do List** project that allows users to **add**, **mark as done**, and **remove** tasks.  
Built using **object-oriented JavaScript**, with a focus on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and clean, modular design.

## 🧭 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a functional To-Do List page where users can:

- 📝 Add tasks to build a personal list of things to do  
- ✅ Mark a task as completed (strike-through effect)  
- ❌ Remove tasks from the list when done  
 

---

## 🧱 Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Add Task** | Users can add a new task by typing in the input field and clicking **Add** |
| ✅ **Mark as Done** | Clicking the check button toggles the task between *done* and *undone* |
| ❌ **Remove Task** | Each task can be deleted from the list |
| 🧠 **TDD Approach** | Core logic was written and tested before connecting the UI |
| 🎨 **UI Enhancement** | A simple interface added for easy user interaction |
